## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

As this project deals with Federal Zero Trust architecture and cryptographic signing, we take security reports seriously. If you discover a potential security flaw in these policies or scripts, please report it responsibly:

1. **Email:** [Your Professional Email or a dedicated security alias]
2. **Details:** Include a description of the vulnerability, the potential impact, and steps to reproduce.
3. **Timeline:** We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for resolution.

## Our Commitment
We are committed to the principles of the **OpenSSF Best Practices**. Once a vulnerability is reported and verified, we will:
* Address the issue in a private fork.
* Coordinate a fix and a public disclosure.
* Update our documentation to prevent similar issues in the future.

## Preferred Security Standards
This project aligns with:
* **NIST SP 800-204D** (Strategies for Integrated Software Supply Chain Security)
* **OpenSSF Scorecard** best practices for repository maintenance.
